# Nasa-APOD 

This application uses NASA's APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) API to allow users to view the astronomical picture or video for any specific date they choose. The user can select a date using an input field and then press a "Fetch Image" button to retrieve and display the corresponding image or video on the screen.

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Fetch API, Nasa's APOD API

This application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple yet effective interface for exploring NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD). The core functionality is powered by the Fetch API, which is used to make requests to NASA's APOD API. When a user selects a specific date, the app uses Fetch to retrieve data from the API, displaying either an image or a video for that day directly on the webpage. The design focuses on providing an intuitive user experience, allowing users to easily navigate and interact with the application to discover daily astronomy content.

## Optimizations

There are some future optimizations i would like to add, such as make the UI more aesthetic and pleasant for the user and also add reposnsiveness for all devices (not responsive currently). Also i noticed that sometimes the images take some time to fully load so it would be a good idea to add a loading indicator to enhance the user experience.

## Lessons Learned:
By building this application i  learned how to handle user input and dynamically update the DOM to provide an interactive user experience. Additionally, I gained valuable experience in working with third-party APIs, like NASA's APOD API, and understanding how to handle different types of data responses, such as images and videos. I didnâ€™t even know there could be a video as a response in the first place, so when I found out while I was playing with the app, I was mind-blown! This unexpected discovery highlighted the importance of thoroughly exploring API documentation and being prepared for a variety of data types.
